# Ripple_test
A setup for basic GraphQL backend service
2 services with:
- one setup for basic GraphQL backend service
- and the other used for MongoDB schema Models and Graphql Type definitions updates.

The Graphql service should have basic Auth endpoints(e.g. Signup & Login), 
however Schema and Types definitions are updated in the other service, 
and at all times the current file versions in the second service are automatically added to the Graphql service on deployment trigger(should be able to test locally as well).â€¨
